# CNN Image Classifier for CIFAR-10

This repository contains Python code for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes two Jupyter Notebooks:

- **CNN_Basic_Implementation_on_CIFAR10_Dataset.ipynb**: Demonstrates implementing a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras. Covers data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

- **CNN_Image_Classifier_GUI.ipynb**: Presents a user-friendly GUI for classifying images using the pre-trained CNN model. Enables easy real-world usage and interaction with the model.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and follow the instructions provided.

## Usage

- **CNN_Basic_Implementation_on_CIFAR10_Dataset.ipynb**: Use this notebook to understand the basic implementation of the CNN model and train it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  
- **CNN_Image_Classifier_GUI.ipynb**: Use this notebook to interact with the trained model using a user-friendly GUI.
